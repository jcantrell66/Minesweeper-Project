# Minesweeper

## Playing the game

The classic game of Minesweeper involves uncovering cells within the grid without popping the mines. Once you have uncovered every cell without hitting a mine, you win! If you hit a mine, you lose.

The grid contains a total of 10 mines. Clicking a cell will display a number, a blank, or a mine. The number within a cell indicates the amount of mines surrounding that cell. If the cell is empty, no mines surround that cell, and your click will reveal all nearby blanks or numbers.

Once you have successfully won or hit a mine, the results of the game will be displayed at the top of the grid.

Click a cell to start the game, or the reset button to replay.
